Slides for my LAS 2021 talk about adaptive apps

## Abstract
Over the past few years we have laid the foundation for an ecosystem of GNOME apps that work seamlessly across form factors, from phones to desktops and everything in between. There are now dozens of core and third party apps using these new adaptive widgets and design patterns, and most new apps are adaptive from day one.

But that's just the beginning: GTK4 is finally out, and apps are starting to move to it. This transition unlocks a whole new world of gestures, animations, and layouts that were not possible before.

In this talk I'll sum up the current state of adaptive GNOME apps, demo some of the most exciting new stuff, and talk about what's in store for the future.

## Demos
Since the framerate during the talk was not great to show off animations, here are the demos so you can build them yourself (just clone in Builder and click run).
